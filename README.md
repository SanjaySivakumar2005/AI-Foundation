🗣️ Language Translator AI Chatbot (English to German)

This project is an AI-powered language translation chatbot that translates English text into German using a pre-trained transformer model. It demonstrates how Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning can be used to build real-time, interactive language translation systems.
✨ Features
✅ Translates English sentences into German
✅ Built using the T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) model
✅ Easy-to-use chatbot interface
✅ Can be integrated into web/mobile applications
✅ Fast and accurate translation results
🧠 How It Works
The chatbot is built using Hugging Face's transformers library and leverages the T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model, which treats all NLP tasks as a text generation problem. Here's a high-level overview of how it works:
The user inputs a sentence in English.
The input is formatted with the prefix translate English to German.
The T5 model processes the input and generates the corresponding German translation.
The chatbot displays the translated text to the user.

🚀 Usage
# Sample usage
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration

model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("t5-base")
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("t5-base")

def translate_english_to_german(text):
    input_text = f"translate English to German: {text}"
    input_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors="pt")
    output_ids = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=100)
    return tokenizer.decode(output_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

# Example
print(translate_english_to_german("How are you?"))
